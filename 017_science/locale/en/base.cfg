[mod-setting-description]
017-drill=(Default enabled) Toggle FFF-266 mining changes (removed hardness). This mod makes all vanilla ore hardness = 1 and makes the burner-mining-drill mining_power = 3, which may break modded ore gating.
017-smelting=(Default enabled) Toggle V's smelting changes (https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?t=64219#p392508). This mod may break ratios for modded recipes using vanilla and modded items.
017-assem-lim=(Default enabled) Toggle the assembly limit removal. This mod affects all assembling-machines and may affect modded crafting stations based on this entity, which may use the limit as a form of gating.
017-old-science=(Default disabled) Toggle the old science recipes (0.16), including LDS. When disabled it removes the ability to use the vanilla science and LDS recipes (except SP 1 & 2) but allows existing crafting machines to continue using the recipe until manually changed.
017-recipes-changes=(Default enabled) atomic-bomb and power-armor-mk2 recipe changes 
017-durability=(Default enabled) All armor now have inf. durability (https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?p=384185#p384185). Axes also have inf. durability to reflect the removal of mining-tool items.
017-axe=(Default enabled) IMPORTANT NOTE: It is highly recomended that infinite durability is enabled when using this option to prevent duplicate items. Implements the FFF-266 changes as best as possible. Instead of mining-tools being crafted, they are inserted and locked to the player's tool slot when they're researched. The best mining-tool is used over lower speed ones.
017-equipment=(Default enabled) Adds belt-immunity-equipment tech and recipe (FFF-256). Note that if another mod that adds belt-immunity-equipment recipe is present, this mod's unlock will be disabled. Disabling this option in an existing game will NOT remove the item - only the recipe & tech.
017-lds=(Default enabled) low-density-structure is also used in multiple advanced personal equipment recipes (mk2 items, fusion reactor, laser defense) instead of steel (FFF-257). NOTE: the cost values in this mod are NOT official, and won't affect other mods (contact me if you want your modded recipe added.). Where possible the cost = math.ceil(n("steel-plate")/2)
017-lds-num=(Default 5, Min 1, Max 32) When steel-plate is not present in vanilla 'high tech' equipment recipes, the cost is determined by the number of "processing-unit"s. math.ceil(n("processing-unit")/thissetting)
017-pack-type-rebalancing=(Default enabled) Enable the rebalancing of high-end technologies into production/utility 'categories' (FFF-275). For example, level-3 modules no longer use utility science and will use production science instead as they increase production.
017-techtree=(Default enabled) Enable the 0.17 techtree. Science packs are now unlocked by dedicated technologies and the rocket-silo no longer requires rocket-speed-5 as a prerequisite (FFF-275 & FFF-245). NOTE: Technologies are dynamically assigned a 'science pack technology' as a prerequisite through script (to work with mods). This may not reflect release tech paths.
017-nuclear-reprocessing-discount=(Default 1000, Min 0, Max 1400) This number is subtracted from the current cost of nuclear-fuel-reprocessing technology (1500). FFF-275 hints at a major discount to this technology ("The Nuclear fuel cell reprocessing is also drastically cheaper") but does not specify an amount.
017-green-cost=(Default 50, Min 0, Max INF.) This value is NOT official and is an estimate based on the difficulty of similar technologies.
017-chem-cost=(Default 200, Min 0, Max INF.) This value is NOT official and is an estimate based on the difficulty of similar technologies.
017-purple-cost=(Default 250, Min 0, Max INF.) This value is NOT official and is an estimate based on the difficulty of similar technologies.
017-gold-cost=(Default 250, Min 0, Max INF.) This value is NOT official and is an estimate based on the difficulty of similar technologies.
017-green-energy=(Default 5, Min 0, Max INF.) This value is NOT official and is an estimate based on the difficulty of similar technologies. Amount of time to research one unit of this technology.
017-chem-energy=(Default 15, Min 0, Max INF.) This value is NOT official and is an estimate based on the difficulty of similar technologies. Amount of time to research one unit of this technology.
017-purple-energy=(Default 30, Min 0, Max INF.) This value is NOT official and is an estimate based on the difficulty of similar technologies. Amount of time to research one unit of this technology.
017-gold-energy=(Default 30, Min 0, Max INF.) This value is NOT official and is an estimate based on the difficulty of similar technologies. Amount of time to research one unit of this technology.
